# **Issues List**

## freebsd - seeing this error in freebsd where freebsd is a virtual - /etc/rc.conf: firstboot-growfs=YES: not found
- no solution

## gentoo - using gnu screen with zsh, but having font issues inside screen. glyphs have turne into question marks. any idea how to address this?

- eselect locale list | grep US
- echo "en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8" | sudo tee -a /etc/locale.gen
- sudo locale-gen
- sudo eselect locale set 4

## tmux: need UTF-8 locale (LC_CTYPE) but have ANSI_X3.4-1968

- echo "en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8" | sudo tee -a /etc/locale.gen
- sudo locale-gen

## powerline not showing glyphs in console
- https://github.com/powerline/fonts/tree â€¦ rminus/PSF

Its up to you where you place the files, I put mine in /usr/share/fonts/PSF. You can test the font using the setfont command and make it permanent by creating or editing /etc/vconsole.conf

FONT=/usr/share/fonts/PSF/ter-powerline-v16b.psf

setfont /path/to/yourfont.ext
#For the fonts already installed you only need the name, so using gr737a-9x16.psfu.gz as an example:

BDF/PCF/PSF fonts are bitmap fonts meaning they describe a character as pixels in a grid.

setfont gr737a-9x16
To see the glyphs in the font, use:

showconsolefont

## kvm fails to start up - even if libvirtd runs as root it starts qemu with user:group defined into /etc/libvirt/qemu.conf (by default nobody:nobody)

- /etc/libvirt/qemu.conf that states qemu runs with group = wheel.

## gentoo - install vagrant, but getting "emerge: there are no ebuilds to satisfy ">=dev-ruby/erubis-2.7.0[ruby_targets_ruby25]"

## dm111psp bridge mode - trying to disable to router capabilities on my Netgear ADSL2+ Modem dm111psp v2 for my Centrylink DSL service.  I have changed VCI 32 to support Century Link and set the device mode to Modem (Modem Only). On my DDWRT router I have set my connection type to PPPoE and put in my username and password from Century Link (for PPoE). My problem is I am not getting a connection and I don't know where my problem is. I am certain the ddwrt side is setup correctly. On my Netgear do I need to disable to firewall? Should I turn of NAT? Thanks.
default:
U: admin
P: password
IP: 192.168.0.1

ADSL Settings
1) change VCI 32

Basic Settings
1) Encapsulation
2) Login, password

Device Mode
1) Modem (Modem Only)

NAT settings?

## awesome wm key bindings

## xmonad xrdp

The xmonad.hs closely emulates the window division behaviors of Wmii / Orion / I3 / Ion, and other non-minimal tiling window managers (eg. not DWM, or other window managers of the strongly "minimalist" flavor). See xmonad.hs for more details...

It focuses heavily on the ability to manipulate multiple independent groups of windows one or more monitors, with a high degree of granularity. The current way that this is abstracted is through the use of LayoutScreens to pretend that the different "panes" of a Rectangle are in fact different screens. The user may work at a higher level of abstraction, not worrying about master-slave window relationships, nor excessively rigid "dynamic" window behavior.

This is particularly useful in a number of circumstances:

When using a widescreen monitor, and more efficient screen utilization of the screen space is desired
When using multiple monitors, and Xinerama or TWinView are unavailable
When using systems with limited or restrictive X servers, that are incapable of using XRender (xrdp sessions with the span option are a case in point for this functionality)

main = xmonad $ desktopConfig
    { startupHook = do
        rects <- xdisplays
        {- spawn xmobar -}
    }

## vim color support
This turned out to be me misunderstanding what the termguicolors option entails in Vim. The ayu colour theme actually requires Truecolor support, which Urxvt does not have.

There is a good explanation of colour support in terminals: https://gist.github.com/XVilka/8346728

This has finally given me a good enough reason to switch to Alacritty.

## Gentoo - Invalid MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 key - startx
I had the same problem a while ago. It took me quite a while to figure out what was wrong. For me the problem was caused by dhcpcd changing my hostname to "localhost". It uses localhost as fallback in case the dhcp server doesn't set any hostname. I worked around the problem by setting "nohook hostname" in /etc/dhcpcd.conf.

A better workaround would be to get the hostname from `xauth list` and add it as a loopback address in /etc/hosts, so it's always valid.

## perl compile on Fedora

- Solution was to create a custom make file for Fedora

## Urxvt paste not working with middle mouse click - mintlinux
- this appears to be happening after enabling perl extentions
- fixed after removing a bad perl extention

- modules not working

## "icons" fonts not displaying in lf (urxvt)
- seems to be an issue with Urxvt
- the icons (glyphs) display in termite
- https://github.com/powerline/powerline/issues/60

- I looked further into the lf font issue. I am using xrdp to access my arch box. When I remote into arch, that is when I am facing the font issue. when I access lf directly on the console the fonts are showing up just fine. This issue only happens in urxvt.

- issue is with font spacing, need to better understand the issue

## Is it possible to configure xmonad to move a program from desktop 1 to 4 (i.e. super+shift+4) and to move to screen 4 without typing super+4 after?
```
karetsu can you not just set a custom keybind to do that?
karetsu> the action being something like W.shift >>=
                 W.greedyView (I forget the actual functions, I'm
                 in windows)

W.shift >>= W.greedyView should abstract to take
                 whatever key you pass as the workspace number, its how you would've defined shift and greedyView in the first place I think
karetsu i.e. I have `"<S> S-", W.shift` as my key
                 binding for shift, I don't have to specify that for my 8 workspaces yeah, probably worth creating a new one just in
                 case reassigning has other implications or
                 breakages (sometimes you might just want to move something out the way?)
 fizzie https://wiki.haskell.org/Xmonad/Frequently_asked_questions#Replacing_greedyView_with_view shows the example of how
                to swap the default 'greedyView' with just 'view' (by using a list comprehension to do it for all 9 workspaces), you should be able to adapt that to your behavior.
 fizzie There's also a variant in
https://hackage.haskell.org/package/xmonad-contrib-0.16/docs/XMonad-Layout-IndependentScreens.html since IndependentScreens also
                involves changing the normal workspace switch keys.
