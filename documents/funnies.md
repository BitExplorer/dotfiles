See you in the funny papers.
Also ... See you in the funny pages.

Refers to the comics section of the newspaper. Was a light hearted way to say goodbye, see you later, in the 1920s through WWII. Not derogatory at all. Could be used with a friend or casual acquaintance. Just a breezy way to say our lives are crazy, like the characters in the comics. Our lives are funny/ironic/interesting I wouldn't be surprised if someone started writing a comic strip based on us. I'll see you around, just as likely in the funny pages as anywhere else.
