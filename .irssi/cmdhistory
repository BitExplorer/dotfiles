: 1568471495:: :; 
: 1568471676:: :;vrs, i just verified I am using spawnPipe for xmobar in my xmonad.hs.
: 1568471803:: :;vrs, it might be happening because of a different issue. when I start xmonad my xmobar is not starting automatically. I then start it from a terminal after startup.
: 1568472201:: :;geekosaur, I am on arch and it is residing on /usr/bin
: 1568472268:: :;geekosaur, this issue is only happening while I am using xrdp to remote into the system. the issue does NOT happen while i am on the console.
: 1568472348:: :;my .xsession-errors file is empty.
: 1568472682:: :;i tried hardcoding the path, but it didn't help.
: 1568472852:: :;geekosaur, https://github.com/BitExplorer/dotfiles/blob/master/.xmonad/xmonad.hs
: 1568472937:: :;geekosaur, yes
: 1568472949:: :;and yes I am using that xmobarrc
: 1568473098:: :;geekosaur, it may be that you are correct in your point above because xmobar appears to not get called or fail on startup.
: 1568473264:: :;i wonder if there is any thing I should set in my .xinitrc to prepare the enviornment for xmonad/xmobar.
: 1568473304:: :;i say that because xrdp is calling .xinitrc
: 1568487383:: :;for xmobar to function correctly are there any enviroment variable required as it is spawned from the xmonad.hs? mine xmobar is failiing to stay up.
: 1568487841:: :;geekosaur, here is what the logs have "<stdin>: hGetLine: end of file"
: 1568488092:: :;geekosaur, i know I have looked this over and everything seems correct.
: 1568488360:: :;i copied your exact command and produced the same line "<stdin>: hGetLine: end of file" 
: 1568488375:: :;found in /tmp/xmobar.errors
: 1568488429:: :;soon after I modified it and I see an active pid - "/bin/sh -c /usr/bin/xmobar .config/xmobar/xmobarrc && ps -ef| grep xmobar > /tmp/xmobar.pid"
: 1568488456:: :;so like you indicated it is starting, but it terminates soon after.
: 1568488533:: :;ok
: 1568488593:: :;here is the code I need that produced that result  "xmproc <- spawnPipe "/usr/bin/xmobar .config/xmobar/xmobarrc && ps -ef| grep xmobar > /tmp/xmobar.pid"
: 1568488799:: :;ok good to know
: 1568488840:: :;after i login i can start xmobar (in the foreground) from a shell and it stays up.
: 1568488942:: :;the StdinReader says Updating... but from what I understand that is expected because it wasn't spawned directly from xmonad.
: 1568489010:: :;exactly what happened :)
: 1568489188:: :;i assume there are no flags to turn on more debugging in xmobar?
: 1568489304:: :;thanks again for your help geekosaur.
: 1568489736:: :;when I pass a -v flag, here is what I see - "13:56 < henninb> for xmobar to function correctly are there any enviroment variable required as it is spawned from the xmonad.hs? mine xmobar is failiing to stay up.

: 1568489736:: :;14:06 < geekosaur> you are using spawnPipe and you use xmproc later in the logHook, so it should be held open
