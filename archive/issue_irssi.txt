05:50 < henninb> hi koobs, i am using irssi and having issue getting unregistered connections to channels. any ideas as to why?
05:51 < koobs> henninb: what auth method do you use?
05:52 < koobs> henninb: if its not SASL, that might be the issue, see: https://freenode.net/kb/answer/sasl
05:52 < henninb> knoobs, autosendcmd = "wait 2000; /msg nickserv identify password" is in my config.
05:52 < koobs> https://freenode.net/catalysts
05:52 < tex> henninb: follow koobs link
05:52 < koobs> tex: but +r and +qa are not for non equality, its for !spam
05:52 < tex> so you'll be identified as soon as connected
05:52 < tex> (remove autosendcmd, obviously ^_^)
05:52 < koobs> henninb: sasl auth happens much earlier in the connection process, so ensures youre auth'd before your client tries to /join
05:53 < koobs> henninb: otherwise its a race to /ns identify (and how long nicksev takes to response)
05:54 < koobs> so in light of all that discussion on better options
05:54 < henninb> knoobs, should I try waiting 4000 ms vs 2000ms?
05:54 < koobs> since we dont have a bot monitor
05:54 < koobs> is +r and overflow to here the best we can do right now ?
05:54 < koobs> henninb: i would just to sasl auth :)
05:54 < koobs> henninb: you may not be able to control the timing of identifies vs joins in the client
05:54 < koobs> unless you write them out serially/scripted
05:54 < koobs> but thats just annoying
05:54 < koobs> SASL auth :)
05:55 < koobs> we've gotten it here too
05:55 < henninb> ahh, got your point, let me look into SASL auth.
henninb> ahh, got your point, let me look into SASL auth.
05:55 < tex> henninb: there is the 'alternative' of your nickserv password as server password
15:47 <+tex> henninb: if you have an irssi-script or similar pkg/port installed

15:49 <+henninb> tex, I am running ubuntu. I will see if there is apt package.
15:49 <+tex> henninb: if you don't know, you must put a symlink in ~/.irssi/script/autorun/ to have it auto-load
15:49 <+bossband> for providing information :))
15:49 <+tex> henninb: yes, it has
15:51 <+tex> IIRC it will install scripts in /usr/share/irssi/scripts/

ln -s /path/to/file /path/to/link
ln -s /usr/share/irssi/scripts ~/.irssi/script/autorun
