# vimdiff commands

## diff put
dp             diffput: puts changes under the cursor into the other file
                        making them identical (thus removing the diff).

## diff get
do             diffget: (o => obtain). The change under the cursor is replaced
                        by the content of the other file making them identical.

## move to the next diff
]c             Jump to the next diff

## move to the previous diff
